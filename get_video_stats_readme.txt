Before running get_video_stats.py make sure to run 'python -m pip install requests' in a terminal to install the ability to ping apis.

-i is the input filename param, defaulted to 'new_ids.csv'
-o is the output filename param

The input file must be a 1 dimensional csv where every new line is a new video id (NOT THE URL). This is the default with an excel-formatted file.
Better options can be made available relatively easily but right now I'm going to bed.
